# StartUp
A Google Chrome extension designed to customize your start up experience with Chrome. I designed this extension to help solve a
problem that was bugging me about Chrome. I kept finding myself opening the same groups of tabs for specific tasks and it was getting
old and repetitive. Making this extension was a large learning process for me and I am hoping that other who want to contribute can 
also learn something from it! There was some interest shown in the project and contributing and that is why I chose to make this 
project Open Source!

## Upcoming Features
These are upcoming features that are already planned on being added in! If yu would like to contribute and work on one of the
features yourself just contact me and ask whether it is already being developed. I am working on getting issues set up for features
where contributors could work on specific features that are posted. If you have suggestions I am always open to hearing how we can
improve StartUp!
